    "    In a large city such as Chicago traffic is an important issue in daily life. Speeding and running red lights can result in serious injuries and deaths. By studying what conditions cause people to speed and run red lights people can learn when to drive more carefully and avoid accidents. We arrived at our hypothesis from personal driving experience, seeing that when in traffic, very few people speed. People do tend to rush to make red lights as they want to get out traffic. This is important because it is based on our own observations and our thought process for what we think we would do if we were driving in Chicago. If it turns out we are incorrect then it shows that there is a in error in our observations while driving and conventional wisdom does not apply. Other people may be making similar assumptions and this would increase the danger of accidents. Also since the hypothesis does not come from previous studies to it has a lower certainty of being correct.\n",
    "    For prior work we have two references. The article, from University of Maryland, “The Relationship Between Congestion Levels and Accidents”, holds a theme similar to our idea, which is to improve the roadway safety. More specifically, it intends to better understand the relationship between congestion levels and the frequency, rate and severity of accidents on freeways. While the article focuses on congestion, we talk about traffic volume, which are similar concepts. We also are focused on speeding and red light running rather than accidents, which are related but not directly the same thing. However, we can still apply the relationship between congestion and accidents to our research with into the relationship between traffic volume and violations. This study found that the number of accidents decreased on arterials but increased on highways. Since we are investigating city roads we should get results similar to their results on what they found on arterials and the number of violations should decrease. This matches our hypothesis for speeding but not for red light violations.\n",
    "    The other article, from Chao Wang, “Impact of traffic congestion on road accidents: A spatial analysis of the M25 motorway in England”, also discusses two important externalities created by road users in England, traffic congestion and road accidents. The interesting point for this research is that the result suggests that traffic congestion has little or no impact on the frequency of road accidents. This does not agree with our hypothesis at all which is interesting. It might not be relevant because english drivers have different rules  and running red lights and speeding happen much more often than, and are not directly correlated with accidents, but it does hint that our reasoning might be wrong.\n",

    "    Since the data is from a government portal it is well formatted. A little peek into the dataset reveals that the average daily traffic data contains no rows of invalid data, while the red light camera data and speeding camera data contains has rows missing the longitude and latitude data and camera id.\n",
    "    We will need to remove all rows containing nan and na in our datasets and get rid of outliers and recording errors. For example time period other than 0:00- 24:00, locations which cannot be found in Chicago(recording errors), and other invalid data. Some of our datasets contain specific street names and some have zip code/area code, we need to combine everything into one table with violations and traffic volume by merging on dates and a single type of location. We will most likely use longitude and latitude information which is present in all sets. Then we can remove any extraneous columns.\n",

    "    First we will look at Average Daily Traffic Counts data to investigate the relationship between total passing vehicle volume and time periods(with respect to different days, months and years). We can visualize the relationships by line charts. Y-coordinate is total passing vehicle volume, and X-coordinate would be time (days, months and years). Then, look at the relationship between total passing vehicle volume and locations. We hope to do this by construction a heat map of traffic overlaid on chicago streets. Next, consider Red Light Camera Violation and Speed Camera Violation datasets. First display a map of where the cameras are located. Then get how many violations were recorded from each camera, and do visualization by a heat map laid out over the city of where violations are most common. As before we will also need to check how the number of violations changes over time. We will need to have a line graph of that over the day months and years. Doing all this will give us sense of the data and help us check that it is properly cleaned and usable.\n",
    "    Then we will analyze the relationship between the violations and traffic volume by plotting the a line graph where the traffic volume during a violation is on the x axis and the number of violations is on the y axis. Then we will perform a linear regression on the model and get the strength of the correlation. We will also want to split up the data by its location and time to see if the relationship is stronger during certain times of the day or of the year or at certain location in the city.\n",

We will also include how strong this relationship is and how other factors such as time and location affect it. We will also include information about the other variables separately such as the relationship between time, location, and violations, as well as time, location, and traffic volume. \n",

Another reason could be failure to identify abnormal data if our data cleaning is poor. This could introduce outliers and make us see a relationship between variable when one does not exist. \n",
